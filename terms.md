1. **serialization**: the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted. This often involves transforming complex data types (like objects and arrays) into a flat, string representation or a binary format.

2. **Garbage collection (GC)** is the process of automatically reclaiming memory that is no longer being used by a program. 

3. **Inlining** - is a compiler optimization technique where the function call is replaced by the function body to avoid the overhead of function calls (such as setting up stack frames), speeding up execution.

4. **Copy elision** is a compiler optimization that avoids unnecessary copying of objects by directly constructing them in place, at the call site.

5. **Inline Caching** is a compiler optimization  to speed up property lookups. It speeds up repeated access to the same property of an object by caching the result of a previous lookup. First lookup is slow but subsequent lookups are fast.


6. A **higher-order function** is a function that can do one or both of the following, 1) Take other functions as arguments. 2) Return a function as a result. Higher-order functions are central to functional programming and enable powerful abstractions such as callbacks, event handlers, and function composition.

7. **Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm**: A two-phase garbage collection process that marks reachable objects and sweeps away unreachable ones.
